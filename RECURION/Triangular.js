// There is a numerical sequence known as “Triangular Numbers.” The
// pattern begins as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward with the Nth
// number in the pattern, which is N plus the previous number. For example,
// the 7th number in the sequence is 28, since it’s 7 (which is N) plus 21
// (the previous number in the sequence). Write a function that accepts a
// report erratum • discuss
// Wrapping Up • 181
// number for N and returns the correct number from the series. That is, if
// the function was passed the number 7, the function would return 28.


const Triangular = (n) => {
    if (n == 0) {
      return 0
    }
    return n + Triangular(n - 1);
  }
  
console.log(Triangular(7))
